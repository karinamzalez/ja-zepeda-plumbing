# SMS Integration for Contact Form

The contact form has been updated to send SMS messages to **210-355-2804** when someone submits the form.

## Current Status

The contact form is ready for SMS integration but currently logs the SMS data to the console. To enable actual SMS sending, you'll need to integrate with an SMS service.

## SMS Service Options

### Option 1: Twilio (Recommended)
**Note**: Requires Node.js 14+ (current system has Node.js 10.19.0)

1. Sign up for a Twilio account at https://www.twilio.com
2. Get your Account SID and Auth Token
3. Purchase a phone number
4. Install Twilio: `npm install twilio`
5. Update the contact API with Twilio integration

### Option 2: TextLocal
1. Sign up at https://www.textlocal.in
2. Get your API key
3. Update the contact API to use TextLocal's API

### Option 3: AWS SNS
1. Set up AWS SNS service
2. Configure credentials
3. Update the contact API to use AWS SNS

### Option 4: Other SMS Services
Many SMS services provide webhook APIs that can be easily integrated.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose an SMS service** from the options above
2. **Get API credentials** from your chosen service
3. **Create environment variables** for your credentials
4. **Update the contact API** (`src/pages/api/contact.ts`) to use the actual SMS service
5. **Test the integration** by submitting the contact form

## Environment Variables Needed

Choose one of the following SMS services and create a `.env.local` file:

### Option 1: AWS SNS (FREE - 1M SMS/month first year) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
```env

```

### Option 2: Email-to-SMS Gateway (Completely Free)
